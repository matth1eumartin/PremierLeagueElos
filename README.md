# Premier League ELO Study

## Description
This project was built using a dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/english-premier-league-results) in order to model the last 20 years in the English Premier League and identify the highest performing team through the use of an ELO system similar to ones used in chess or the FIFA international team rankings. I then used Matplotlib to graph the outputs of applying the ELO system to the fixtures, before conducting an analysis on the traditional 'Big 6' teams - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - with a bonus look at Leicester City! Key dates in each of these clubs history were marked, and a short paragraph explaining the graph was written. The project also includes an all time ranking at the end of the 2021/22 season, with predictions for the 2022/23 season based on their current ELO (these aged horribly).

## Accessing the Project
While opening the Jupyter Notebook file would be enough if you wish to have a look at the study, you may wish to fork this repository and play around with the K values for the model yourself. In this case, assumming you already have a way to access Jupyter Notebooks and Python 3.9 installed, the only other packages required are:
* pandas 
* matplotlib
* numpy
* re

Once you have all of the above installed, you should be good to go!

Thank you very much for reading all this if you made it this far, I hope you enjoyed :)
